## Introduction
Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm [Your Name], and this is my digital playground where I showcase the cool stuff I've been working on. ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Motivation
I like coding and the complexities areoind it.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
